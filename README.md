# Human-Activity-Recognition


Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problem that is an active research field in pervasive
computing. An HAR system has the main goal of analyzing human activities by observing
and interpreting ongoing events successfully. Such a system can either use visual or nonvisual
(sensory) data. 

Visual systems typically use one or multiple cameras to monitor human activities. Such
systems are deployed in applications such as surveillance for behavioural analysis to identify
suspicious activities in crowded areas. HAR based on sensory data can be further divided
into external sensors and body-worn sensors. When using external sensors, they are placed
in the environment. IoT based systems such as in smart homes contain multiple sensors that
monitor the activities and are used for home automation. Body-worn sensor based HAR
systems have a major advantage over other methods as the activity monitoring zone is not
limited to a confined region.
Among various applications of body-worn sensor HAR systems, below are few of them:


For this project, data from the inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) is chosen. Accelerometer
and gyroscope measure the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the smartphone.
Although various additional sensors can be used together with accelerometer and
gyroscope, previous works like [13] and [14] have shown that additional sensors show very
low improvements compared to using these sensors alone.
